# -TensorFlow-MNIST

Deep Neural Network with TensorFlow

The MNIST dataset, which is a dataset that contains 60,000 training samples and 10,000 testing samples of hand-written and labeled digits, 0 through 9, so total "10 classes."
The MNIST dataset has the images, which working with as purely black and white, thresholded, images, of size 28 x 28, or 784 pixels total.

Input data --> (weights) --> hidden_layer_1(Activation function) -->(weights) --> hidden_layer_2(Activation function) --> (weights) --> output layer
Comparing output to intended output --> (Cost function)
optimization function(optimizer) --> min cost
